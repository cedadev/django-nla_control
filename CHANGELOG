CHANGELOG for nla_control
=========================

0.1 -> 0.2
==========

1. Added ``RestoreDisk`` model.  This allows multiple locations to restore files to.  These
   may be separate disks or areas of the same disks.  ``RestoreDisks`` can be added via the
   Django admin webpages.  When the request is processed the ``process_requests`` script finds
   a ``RestoreDisk`` with enough space free to hold the request.
   
2. Quotas are now enforced.  Users who have exceeded their quota will not be able to make
   any further requests.  Also, users are prevented from making requests that will exceed
   their quota.

3. Removed ``VerifyLogs`` model - no longer needed.

4. Implemented a test system which is independent of the actual tape archive.  See: 
   https://breezy.badc.rl.ac.uk/nrmassey/cedanla-test-playbook

0.2 -> 0.3
==========

1. Requests to restore files are now persistent.  This means that files can be requested
   which are not currently in the NLA system, or even in the archive.  As the files are
   added to the NLA system (via the archive) the process_requests script will recognise
   that these files are now available and restore them.  This works for both pattern_requests
   and listing_requests.  For example, for a pattern_request of MSLP_2017, when the
   ``process_requests`` script is first run it will restore all files that have "MSLP_2017"
   in their filename.  As more files which match the pattern are added to tapte throughout
   2017, the ``process_requests`` script will recognise the new files and restore them.

2. Email notifications have now been implemented.

3. The restore process (process_requests) now fills in the ``first_files_on_disk`` and
   ``last_files_on_disk`` fields in TapeRequest.

4. Removed ``DELETED`` state from ``TapeFile.``

5. Users are limited to two requests being processed at any one time.  Users can make
   multiple requests, but only two will be processed at a time.
   
6. Fixed a problem with multiple checksum logs.  The checksum process (run by Brian Coan)
   might create more than one file of checksums for each fileset, especially if the process
   is interrupted or the process is run, more files become available and the process is
   run a second time to get the checksums for the new files.  Previously only the first
   checksum file for the fileset was checked.  This has been fixed so that the checksum 
   files are checked in order, with the newest first, until a file with ``stage==VERIFY``
   is found.  (All files after this point should already have been verified and it saves
   processing time by only verifying the new files).
   
7. Fixed a problem where expiring two requests with common files would cause the common
   files to be removed from the NLA system due to the logic of the ``tidy_requests`` 
   script.  This has been fixed by checking that the files to be removed have the status
   of ``stage==RESTORED``.  In this case, when the first request is expired the common
   files will then have ``stage==ONTAPE`` so there will be no attempt to remove them a
   second time.
   
8. Fixed a problem where requests could be loaded into more than one slot if the
   ``process_requests`` is run repeatably.  Requests are only now added to slots if no
   other slots contains the same ``TapeRequest``.
